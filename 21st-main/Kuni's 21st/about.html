    <p>The task is to provide examples of different types of traditional and cultural expressions (riddles, stories, poems, etc.) from these different historical and cultural periods, showcasing how each culture evolved through time.
        <br>
        <br>
        1. Pre-colonial: This period refers to the time before the arrival of colonial powers in a particular region. For example, in the Philippines, this would refer to the time before the Spanish colonization in the 1500s.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. Spanish: This would refer to the period of Spanish colonization, which in many countries lasted from the 16th to the 19th century. It often had a significant influence on language, religion, and culture.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. American: This might refer to the period of American influence or colonization, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries. For example, in the Philippines, this period refers to the time after the Spanish-American War when the U.S. took control.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. Japanese: Refers to the period of Japanese occupation and influence, particularly in East and Southeast Asia, such as the occupation of the Philippines during World War II.
        <br>
        <br>
        5. Post-colonial: Refers to the period after a country gained independence from colonial rule. This would include the time after a nation reclaimed its sovereignty and began to rebuild and redefine its identity..</p>
