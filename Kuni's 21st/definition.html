            has keys but can’t open locks?” (a piano) or a mind-bending logic puzzle, riddles are a fun way to keep your brain
             sharp. They show how language can be playful and tricky at the same time, making even the simplest words take on 
             new meanings. So next time you hear a good riddle, take a moment to enjoy the challenge—you might surprise yourself
              with the answer!</br></p>
              <p> <br>2. A <B>short story </B>is a brief work of fiction that tells a complete tale in a limited number of words, usually focusing on one main character, a central conflict, and a single setting. Unlike novels, short stories cut straight to the point, delivering emotion, suspense, or a twist in just a few pages.

                Short stories often revolve around a key moment or realization in a character’s life, making them impactful despite their length. They rely on strong imagery, sharp dialogue, and concise storytelling to engage readers quickly. Many short stories explore themes like love, loss, mystery, or adventure, leaving readers with something to think about even after they’re done reading.
                
                Since they’re short, every word counts. There’s little room for unnecessary details, so authors focus on what truly matters—whether it’s a shocking ending, a powerful message, or a simple yet touching slice of life. Some of the best short stories stay with readers forever, proving that a great story doesn’t need hundreds of pages to be meaningful.
                
                In short, a short story is like a snapshot of life, giving just enough detail to spark the imagination while leaving some things up to the reader.</br></p>
                <p> <br>3. A <B> Poem</B> is a form of literary expression that uses rhythm, imagery, and carefully chosen words to convey emotions, ideas, or stories. Unlike regular writing, poems don’t always follow strict grammar rules or traditional sentence structures—they can be short or long, rhyme or not, and even take on unique shapes on the page.

                    Poetry is all about feeling. It captures moments, emotions, and thoughts in a way that often goes beyond what regular sentences can do. Some poems tell stories, while others paint vivid pictures with words or express deep emotions in just a few lines.
                    
                    There are many types of poetry, from structured forms like sonnets and haikus to free verse, which doesn’t follow any specific rules. What makes a poem special is its ability to make readers feel something—whether it’s joy, sadness, nostalgia, or inspiration.
                    
                    Poems can be personal, political, romantic, or completely abstract. They often play with language through metaphors, similes, and symbolism, giving them layers of meaning. Even though they’re usually short, a well-written poem can leave a lasting impact, proving that sometimes, fewer words can say the most.</br></p>
                    <p> <br>4. A <b>legend</b> is a traditional story passed down through generations, often blending historical facts with myths and fantasy. These stories usually explain the origins of places, events, or heroic figures, making them a mix of reality and imagination. Unlike fairy tales, legends are often believed to have some truth, even if they’ve been exaggerated over time.

                        Legends usually center around larger-than-life characters—brave warriors, wise leaders, or mysterious creatures—who accomplish extraordinary feats. These stories often teach lessons, reflect cultural beliefs, or explain natural phenomena in a way that keeps people intrigued.
                        
                        Many legends are tied to specific locations or historical events, giving them a sense of authenticity. Some of the most famous ones include King Arthur’s tales, the legend of Atlantis, or local folklore about hidden treasures and mythical beings. While no one can confirm their truth, legends continue to be retold, shaping cultures and sparking curiosity.
                        
                        In short, legends are stories that walk the fine line between history and myth, passed down to entertain, teach, and keep traditions alive. Even if we don’t know how much is true, they remind us of the power of storytellin</br></p>
                        <p> <br>5. <b> Myth </b>is a traditional story that explains the origins of the world, natural events, or human behavior, often involving gods, supernatural beings, or legendary heroes. Unlike legends, which may have some historical basis, myths are usually entirely fictional but hold deep cultural and religious significance.

                        Myths often try to answer big questions—like how the world was created, why the sun rises and sets, or why certain traditions exist. They feature powerful deities, magical creatures, and epic battles between good and evil. Many ancient civilizations, like the Greeks, Romans, and Norse, used myths to explain things they didn’t understand.
                        
                        These stories were passed down through generations, shaping beliefs and traditions. Some famous myths include Zeus and Mount Olympus, the story of Pandora’s Box, and the creation myths from different cultures. Even though they were created long ago, myths continue to inspire literature, movies, and art today.
                        
                        In short, myths are more than just stories—they are a window into how ancient people saw the world. Whether they explain nature, morality, or the divine, myths continue to fascinate and influence modern storytelling.</br></p>
